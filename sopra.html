        <h1>Fixed Term Deposits</h1>

      <article>
        <p>Fixed term deposits are a cornerstone of personal banking, offering customers a secure way to earn interest on their savings. However, managing these investments can often be complex and opaque. Our goal was to simplify this process, making it more intuitive, engaging, and informative.</p>

        <h2>My Role and Contributions</h2>
        <p>As the lead product designer, I was responsible for overseeing the entire design process, from initial research through to the final user testing and iteration stages. My contributions included conducting user interviews, developing wireframes and prototypes, and implementing user feedback to refine the product.</p>

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Streamlining Onboarding</strong>: Simplifying the process for new users to create a fixed term deposit account.</li>
