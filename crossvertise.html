        <h1>OOH Booking Redesign</h1>

      <article>
        <p>Our current out-of-home (OOH) booking process isn't user-friendly, leading to a high number of users abandoning the purchase page. Our aim is to overhaul the user flow, making the booking process more intuitive and straightforward.</p>
        
        <h2>My Role and Contributions</h2>
        <p>As the lead designer, I oversaw the entire redesign process, from initial research to final implementation. I conducted user interviews, crafted wireframes and prototypes, and iterated based on user feedback to refine the product.</p>

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Simplifying Onboarding</strong>: Making it easy for new users to navigate through the booking process.</li>
            <li><strong>Clarifying Information</strong>: Ensuring that all necessary details are clearly presented without the need for additional explanations.</li>
            <li><strong>Communication</strong>: Implementing effective notifications to keep users informed throughout the process.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Design Process</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Research</strong>: Conducted market analysis and user interviews to understand user needs and pain points.</li>
            <li><strong>Ideation</strong>: Brainstormed solutions to enhance user experience and streamline the booking process.</li>
            <li><strong>Prototyping</strong>: Developed and refined prototypes to visualize our proposed solutions.</li>
            <li><strong>User Testing</strong>: Gathered feedback through extensive user testing to validate design decisions.</li>
            <li><strong>Iteration</strong>: Incorporated user feedback to iteratively improve the design and usability.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Results and Insights</h2>
        <p>Introduction of a simplified user flow led to a 35% decrease in bounce rates, indicating improved user engagement. User feedback also highlighted enhanced satisfaction with the booking process.</p>

        <h2>Visuals and Prototypes</h2>
        <p>Detailed mockups and prototypes are available upon request, showcasing the evolution of our design from concept to implementation. These visuals demonstrate our user-centric approach and iterative design process.</p>
